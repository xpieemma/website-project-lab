    <p>  Jason Mraz sang 'I won't give up on us / Even if the skies get rough.' 

<br>A software engineer requires a set of discipline, character, skills, and virtues—a holistic framework that sustains effort through difficulty. 
<br> Bob Marley declared in his anthem to enduring spirit, 'Rastaman Live Up.'
<br>It is the creed of the builder, the coder, the problem-solver: An artist never gives up. Sooner or later, the inspiration will come from any trigger.</p>
